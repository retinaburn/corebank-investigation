-- Development reset: deletes all application data and Spring Batch job history.
-- Stop core commands and other database writers before running this script.
-- Requires migrations through 006. Liquibase history and schema definitions remain.
-- Input/output/error files on disk are not removed: move old output files aside
-- before reusing batch dates, or the exporter may reject conflicting contents.
-- CASCADE also truncates any additional tables referencing the listed tables.

-- Children precede parents for readability. PostgreSQL truncates this entire
-- related set in one statement; separate child-first statements are insufficient
-- to satisfy TRUNCATE's foreign-key requirements without CASCADE.
